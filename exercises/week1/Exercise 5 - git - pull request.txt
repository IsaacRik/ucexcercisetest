Exercise 5

In your forked repository 

create a branch (see exercise 3) if you haven't already

Add a new folder and file using your student id in the "students" folder

commit your changes and push them to your github forked repository

On github

Go to your repository and there should be a "compare and pull request" button at the top of your repository

Select it and enter in a comment about what you are committing to the repository

The owner of the repository (me) will be notified that there are new pull requests, I will be able to merge the changes, 
once it is done I will be able to merge your changes and delete your branch (create new branches for each pull request)

this process is the way that we will submit the code for your projects
