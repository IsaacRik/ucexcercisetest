Exercise 3

In VS Code

In the terminal

Create a new branch called "firstbranch"
> git branch firstbranch

Press the refresh button (next to the tick to commit in the source control sidebar)

In the bottom left corner of the screen, the git symbol will show with the name of the current branch you are working on

Select it and a list of avialable branches will be shown, select "firstbranch" to switch to your branch

Now make a change to your "Hello.txt" and push it to github

In GitHub

go to the website to check your new changes - they will not be shown

Look for the master branch pull down (mid top left of the page)

Open the pull down menu and select the "firstbranch" branch

You should now be able to see the changes in "Hello.txt" that you just committed
