Exercise 2

Goto the GitHub site

* Here - https://github.com/

Create an account for yourself

Go to repositories and create a new repository - call it something like - ucexercisetest
Do Not tick the initialize this repository with a README

Now in VS CODE - using your terminal

You need to tell VS code your new login details to GitHub (obviously user the username you created)
> git config --global user.name "John Doe"

and your email address (obviously use your email you used for github)
> git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Use this command to add the remote repository to your remote backup
> git remote add origin https://github.com/[yourusername]/ucexercisetest.git

Then use this command to push your files onto the cloud
> git push -u origin master

You can now go back to github in your browser and refresh the page to see your "Hello.txt" backed up

Now when you do a commit in VS Code on your local machine you will need to "Push" the changes to GitHub

To do this in VS Code, in the three dot menu above the message box 
(near the tick to commit) select push or sync to upload to github
