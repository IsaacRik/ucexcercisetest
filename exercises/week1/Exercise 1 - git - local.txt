Exercise 1

Download the git packages to your machine 

* Here - https://git-scm.com/

In VS Code 
Open your new folder (File -> Open Folder)
Open a new terminal (Terminal menu -> New Terminal)

At the commmand prompt - (PS D:\Folder> or similar )
Type:
    > git init
Initialized empty Git repository in (your folder)/.git/

You now have a local backup system setup on this folder 
Create a new file in this folder (File -> New File)
Write Hello World! in the file and press save 
save the file as "Hello.txt"

On the side bar on the left - you should see a symbol with a blue bubble with a 1 in init
This is the source control command view - click on init

You will now see the Explorer change to a Source Control bar

Under the "Changes" heading will be the file "Hello.txt" with a green U (currently untracked) symbol to the right
Press the + symbol to the right of its name

The "Hello.txt" file will now be moved up a heading called "Staged Changes" and it will have a green A (added to tracking) to the right

Above this is a "Message" box - write "first commit" in this box
Press the "Tick symbol" that is above the message box when you are ready

You "Hello.txt" file will now disappear entirely - this means that it has been saved and everything is up to date

Each time you make a change to this file the source control will see it and flag to let you know you need to commit.
You only need to commit when you want to save a backup copy, when you finish something important or at the end of the day.

Add some extra text and commit a second time.

At the top right of the screen there are some additional git icons, find the "Open Changes with Previous Revision"
when you select this a split screen will show with your current version and the last commit you did, showing what you have added/removed/changed
You can use the other options at the top to review different commits/versions of your file
