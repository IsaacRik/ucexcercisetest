Exercise 4

Got to - https://github.com/UC-Design/11055-PfD-2020-2

In the top right of the page is a fork button, select it and 'fork' the repository into your repository set

Then you need to clone (copy and link) your new fork onto your local machine

On github

Go to your new forked repository - https://github.com/yourusername/11055-PfD-2020-2

Select the Code button (green button on the right hand side near the middle of the page)

Copy the url under the clone with HTTPS heading

In VS Code

In the Terminal

> git clone [clone url copied from above]

Select the folder to put your cloned files

Wait for it to download all the files onto your machine

You can now open files and look at what is in the respository on your local machine

-------- Create a branch now - it is best practise to create a branch before making any changes to remote repositories

To allow you to keep your local copy up to date, you have a link to your clone but not to the original, so 

In the terminal 

add an extra remote place to get information if it changes - called upstream
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/UC-Design/11055-PfD-2020-2

When you want to download any changes from the original 
> git fetch upstream 

Make sure that all your changes are merged into the newest version
> git rebase upstream/master
